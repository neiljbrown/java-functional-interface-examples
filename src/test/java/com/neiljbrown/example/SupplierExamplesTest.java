/**
 * Class containing examples of using Java's {@link Supplier} interface which represents an operation with zero
 * operands/args that returns a result.
 * <p>
 * The {@link Supplier} functional interface defines a type of Function that supplies (returns) a value without
 * requiring any arguments. It provides a level of indirection that is typically used to defer the (lazy)
 * generation or retrieval of a value until it is definitely needed, at the time it is needed.
 * <p>
 * Similarly to {@link java.util.function.Function} and {@link java.util.function.BiFunction} there are
 * specializations of Supplier functional interface to support primitive return types, such as  BooleanSupplier,
 * DoubleSupplier, LongSupplier and IntSupplier.
